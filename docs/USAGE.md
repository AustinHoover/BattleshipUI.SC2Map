# Usage
## Adding a mission
To add a mission,
1. Navigate to `CUSTOM/Missions/RegisterMissions` in the Trigger window.
2. Copy-paste the block that the comments tell you to. Paste the block immediately below the existing one.
3. Update the `Set MissionIndex` action that the comment instructs you to. This should be the next highest number.
  - IE, if you copied a block with `Set MissionIndex` equal to `0`, you should set your pasted block to be `1`.
4. Navigate to the `CUSTOM/Missions/MissionCount` variable in the Trigger window.
5. Update the mission count variable to be the new number of missions.
